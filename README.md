# Code Quest

#### React and JavaScript Capstone Exercise for Epicodus, 10.05.2020

## By Jeff Kim

## Description

This capstone project is designed to present the concept of StackOverflow and other such code help sites and present it in a highly gamified form. The format will be similar to an RPG quest board, where users will be able to post code help requests in the form of "quests". Users can post details related to their quest, such as their preferred coding language, project objectives/details, and any additional goals they may have. Users who post quests can also post a "bounty", which will be a reward of virtual currency that will be given to the first person who successfully completes the code request.

Users will earn this currency by (obviously) completing quests, but will also have methods to earn currency passively so that no one will ever be left without the ability to post or complete requests. Daily activities such as quizzes, user participation events, and other interactions will allow them to earn and save nominal amounts of currency so that the community will remain accessible to anyone, regardless of their skill level. Beyond that, currency use can be extrapolated to any number of stretch features, such as promoting your own quest or adding onto the bounty of a quest you would like to know the answer to, as well. Eventually, corporate sponsors may even be able to introduce "Legendary Quests" similar to bug bounties that require community participation to complete.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
