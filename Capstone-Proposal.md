#### Code Quest

##### Description
A web and phone app that displays coding help questions as “quests” – likely with a fantasy or RPG theme. Users can post quests and approve answers to their quests and receive gamified rewards for fulfilling others’ quests.

##### Use Case
Main users for this product are anyone who engages with code – professionals, students, and hobbyists. This product will help programmers resolve issues with their code, gain a better understanding of programming concepts, and learn best practices and the underlying theory for those practices. The goal of this project is to create a polished space where users can find the answers via a highly gamified interface and incentivize others to answer their questions with social and potentially monetary rewards.

##### Minimum Viable Product
(List the absolute minimum features the project requires before it is considered in a pre-alpha state)
•            Users can post coding questions in the form of “Quests” to a public forum
•            Users can answer coding questions to fulfill “Quests”
•            Users can approve answers to the quests they post

##### Tools for MVP
(List the tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules, resources, languages, etc that will be used to create your MVP. Be specific.)
•            JavaScript
•            React
•            Firebase/Firestore


##### Additional Features
•            Assigning and rewarding "currency" bounties for quests
•            Refine gamification model to allow the spending of earned currency
•            Allow users to promote their quests using currency they’ve earned
•            Allow “premium” users to initiate a live code session to either solve or ask for a quest to be solved
•            Mobile app and/or mobile push notifications for quest status updates

##### Tools for Additional Features
•            JavaScript
•            React
•            React Native
•            Android Dev Kit

##### Additional Information
This project is not intended to be a replacement for Stack Overflow, which I believe fulfills a role in the programming world that I would best describe as a marriage of Wikipedia and reddit. Instead, this platform would focus less on the social aspects of code requests and adopt a highly incentivized MO to mimic “bug bounties” that large companies put out and leverage that structure to help programmers at all levels get the answers they need to advance their own goals.
